## Project Description
The Sign Language Detection Project aims to recognize sign language gestures using neural networks. By leveraging deep learning techniques, we seek to create a model that can accurately translate gestures into text or speech, facilitating communication between deaf and hearing individuals.

## Course Information
- **Subject Code:** CS 584 Machine Learning
- **Term:** Fall 2024
- **Professor:** Shouvik Roy

## Key Objectives
- Develop a robust model to recognize sign language gestures.
- Implement real-time gesture translation.
- Enhance accessibility for the deaf community.

### This project is our submission for CS 584 Machine Learning Fall 2024
